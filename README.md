<h1> Introduction to Blockchain </h1>

Blockchain is defined as a public database. It’s shared and updated to many computers under a network. Block is considered as data, This is stored in consecutive groups called Blocks. When you send ETH to someone, the transaction data needs to add to a block successfully. The chain is referred to the fact when every Block is cryptographically referred to its parent. Block is getting chained together in other words. The data in the Blockchain is not changed without
changing all subsequent Blocks.  Ethereum uses a proof-of-work mechanism. This allows everyone can add new chains to the Blocks. But, it needs to solve a difficult puzzle that needs a lot of computing power. Doing this is known as Mining that is rewarded by ETH. New blocks are broadcasted to the nodes in the network, verified, and checked. It’s updating the state of the Blockchain for every trader.
